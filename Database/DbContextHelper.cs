/*** Original author: https://github.com/Lampjaw
 * Modified by https://github.com/Twinki14 for OSItemIndex
 * DbContextHelper: Helper class we can use with DI to inject a factory (DbContextFactory) of our dbContext into our modules/services
 * DbContextFactory: Contains a scopeFactory instance and creates a new DbContext instance from the scopeFactory
 * General notes:
 *      Using a factory pattern instead of sharing a DbContext between our services injected by DI gives us the benefit of concurrency/thread-safety,
 *          better performance, and memory management assuming we use it properly. We inject DbContextHelper into each service that requires access to our DbContext
 *          with DI, use GetFactory to access the factory which creates a new underlying DbContext instance using the scope factory,
 *          and GetDbContext to access that context. When we no longer need to use our DbContext, we dispose of our DbContextFactory instance created
 *          by the injected DbContextHelper instance, which also disposes the underlying DbContext. With the help of a DbContextPool this gives us a ton of benefits
 *          as an API making multiple queries to our DbContext.
 *
 * Potential improvements:
 *      Making use of generics so this code can be easily-re-usable and testable
